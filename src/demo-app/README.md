# react-circle-of-fifths demo app

This is a very simple little demo application that I use while developing this component.

It does nothing more complex than rendering the `CircleOfFifths` component and displaying the currently selected key.

# Running the demo app

I use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to run this app when I work on the component because it's very low effort. This may change if my needs become more complex, but it works great for now.

Once you've cloned this repository and installed the dependencies via `yarn` or `npm`, you can start the app with parcel like so:

With NPX:
```
npx parcel src/demo-app/index.html
```

With Yarn:
```
yarn parcel src/demo-app/index.html
```
